Edit : I am so hyped for this movie and seeing Unicron and Scourge live action for the first time and I'm so glad Peter Cullen is still able to voice the iconic Optimus prime and to see the new maximals, terracons, predacons, autobots and our human protagonists in action   I hope to see some dicepticons too later down the line like Soundwave , shockwave , Megatron , ravage , laserbeak and
